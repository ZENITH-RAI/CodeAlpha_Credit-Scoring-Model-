üìã Overview

This project builds a machine learning‚Äìbased Credit Scoring System that predicts whether a loan applicant is likely to default on a loan based on their financial history.
Using advanced classification algorithms and feature analysis, the model helps financial institutions make accurate, data-driven credit decisions.

üìÇ Dataset

File: credit.csv
Target Column: loan_default
Feature Examples:

income

loan_amount

debt_to_income_ratio

payment_history_score

num_of_credit_lines

age

‚öôÔ∏è Features

Automated target column detection

Missing value handling (median/mode imputation)

Label encoding for categorical columns

Feature scaling using StandardScaler

Model comparison (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest)

Evaluation metrics: Precision, Recall, F1-Score, ROC-AUC, and Cross-Validation

Feature importance and confusion matrix visualization

Model persistence using joblib

üöÄ How It Works
1Ô∏è‚É£ Load Dataset

The program loads data from credit.csv and checks for missing or invalid values.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Preprocess Data

Cleans and encodes categorical features, fills missing values, and scales numeric data.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Train & Evaluate Models

Three models are trained and compared using stratified 5-fold cross-validation:

Logistic Regression

Decision Tree

Random Forest

4Ô∏è‚É£ Analyze Results

The Random Forest model achieves the highest performance with perfect classification on the test data.
Feature importance and confusion matrix visualizations are generated automatically.

5Ô∏è‚É£ Save Best Model

The best model is saved as:

credit_model.pkl


This allows easy loading and use in real-world applications.

üìä Example Outputs
Feature Importance

Shows which financial features most influence loan default:

Top Predictors:
1. Payment History Score
2. Debt-to-Income Ratio
3. Income

Confusion Matrix

Displays how accurately the model classifies loan defaulters vs non-defaulters.

üß† Insights

Payment History Score and Debt-to-Income Ratio are the strongest predictors.

The Random Forest Classifier outperformed other models in precision, recall, and F1-score.

Perfect predictions indicate clean data and strong feature separation.

üíæ Saving & Loading Model

To save the trained model:

joblib.dump(best_model, "credit_model.pkl")


To load it later:

model = joblib.load("credit_model.pkl")
